# QR_Code_Generator
This project is a Python-based QR Code Generator built inside a Jupyter Notebook (VS Code or Google Colab). It takes user input, generates a QR code, displays it in the notebook, and saves it locally as a PNG file. The project is simple, interactive, and ideal for learning basic Python concepts.
